<p>I randomly spotted Guy at the ATL airport today. Ended up chatting and hanging out with him in the Delta Sky Lounge before our flight. I even got him to download the Mashable iPad app that we built. Such a nice person and I'm very happy he didn't ignore me since I'm pretty sure he gets bugged by techies like me all the time :)
