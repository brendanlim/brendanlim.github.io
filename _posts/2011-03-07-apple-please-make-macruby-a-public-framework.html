<p>I'm a big fan of <a href="http://macruby.org">MacRuby</a> and have been a big supporter.  For those of you who don't know, MacRuby allows you to create awesome Mac OS X apps using Ruby.  I'm even writing a book on it - <a href="http://manning.com/lim">MacRuby in Action</a>.  </p>
<p>What's not so awesome is that even though Apple has chosen to include MacRuby in Mac OS X Lion, it's only available as a private framework.  This means that MacRuby developers are forced to <em>embed</em> the framework within their applications.  It'd be great if Apple could make MacRuby a public framework within OS X Lion. </p>
<p>The author of another MacRuby book, <a href="http://merbist.com">Matt Aimonetti</a>, posted about this today and asked me to help bring some more attention to the issue.  He's created a <a href="http://bugreporter.apple.com/">ticket</a> on Apple's radar system and <a href="http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=1131407">so have I</a>.</p>
<p>If you have time, please help us with this and spread the word.  It'd also be great if you could <a href="http://bugreporter.apple.com/">open up a radar ticket</a> as well.</p>
