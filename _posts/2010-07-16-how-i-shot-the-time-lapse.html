<p>I've always wanted to do a time-lapse but didn't want to shell out the money for the intervalometer from Canon.  So what, i did was just hook up my Canon 5D Mk II to my laptop and used Canon's EOS Utility, which pretty much allows you to do the same thing.  I had it shoot continuously from 7:30pm to about 9:30pm in 5 second intervals.  I ended up with around 1450 shots.  I first tried putting together the video at 15fps, which ended up being kind of choppy.  24fps yielded one minute of footage but wasn't fluid enough, so I went with 30fps.  </p>
<p>One thing I did learn though, was to not use auto-focus.  You can notice a shift in the focusing when it starts to get darker.  Overall though, I'm happy with the results and will definitely give this another shot sometime soon.</p>
