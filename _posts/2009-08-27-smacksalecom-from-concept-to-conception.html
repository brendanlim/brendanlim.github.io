<p>My colleagues, Adam Bair, Pradeep Elankumaran, Paul Ostazeski and I ended up building an app within 48 hours for this year's Rails Rumble.  We had a couple ideas at first but we decided to try keep it simple to make sure that we had enough time to iron things out.  We decided to do a deals aggregator with a little mix of Digg/Reddit thrown in.  Smacksale.com allows you to vote up or down deals that you either love or hate.  </p>
<div>It's also interesting to note how much planning went into it.  The only bit of planning we did was this little mockup that I drew up (I can't draw straight lines for the life of me).  Smacksale stayed pretty much true to the initial mockup.  If you have time, check out Smacksale (<a href="http://smacksale.com">http://smacksale.com</a>).  </div></p>
