<p>This was shot and edited on an iPhone 4 using iMovie for iPhone. I was in line accompanying my friend Spencer when he went to go get an iPhone 4 at Lenox Mall in Atlanta, GA. I had already received mine a day earlier since I had pre-ordered online, so I was free to just record and snap pics the whole time.</p>
