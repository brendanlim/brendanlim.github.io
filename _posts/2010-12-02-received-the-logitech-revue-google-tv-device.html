<p>I received the Logitech Revue in the mail today.  I was lucky enough to get one of the 10,000 that Google sent out to developers.  First impressions?  It sucks without cable (i canceled my cable) -- which is pretty obvious, since Google TV is all about combining [cable] TV, web, apps, and making them all work together seamlessly.  The apps are extremely limited at the moment, since there's no Android Marketplace for Google TV.  I just can't wait until Google releases the SDK and allows us developers to make Google TV apps.  It's a great little device and it's making me think about getting cable again just to get a feel for the true Google TV experience.
