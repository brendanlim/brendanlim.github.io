<p>The first ever <a href="http://rubyconfindia.org" target="_new">RubyConf India</a> took place in Bangalore, India at the Royal Orchid Hotel last weekend.  Our Director of Research &amp; Development, Pradeep Elankumaran, and I were there speaking.  The event was put together by ThoughtWorks and was unlike any other tech conference we've ever attended.  It wasn't the talks, the speakers, or the format -- it was the overall attitude of everybody who attended RubyConf India 2010 that made it very special to us.  Everybody who attended were extremely passionate about learning and showed so much interest in all of the topics that were presented for the two days of the conference.</p>
