<blockquote type="cite"><div>Dear Apple Store Customer,</p>
<p> You recently received a Shipment Notification email from Apple advising you that your iPhone has shipped.</p>
<p> This email is to confirm that your delivery will occur on June 23rd. Although Apple and FedEx tracking information may currently indicate a later date, you can check the FedEx website the morning of the June 23rd to track your package to your doorstep.</p>
<p> In the event that you will not be available to accept delivery on June 23rd, it may be more convenient to use our pre-sign delivery option by visiting our Order Status website at <a href="http://www.apple.com/orderstatus"></a><a href="http://www.apple.com/orderstatus">http://www.apple.com/orderstatus</a>.</p>
<p> Sincerely,</p>
