<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>Once the lab receives your sample, DNA is extracted from cheek cells in  your saliva. Your DNA is then copied many times so that there is enough  DNA to use for the genotyping step. Next, the DNA is cut into smaller,  more manageable pieces. These DNA pieces are then applied to a DNA  “chip.” The DNA chip is a small glass slide with millions of microscopic  beads on its surface. Attached to each bead are “probes”—bits of DNA  complementary to sites in your genome where SNPs are located. There is a  pair of probes for each SNP, corresponding to the two versions of each  SNP. Because two complementary pieces of DNA stick together, your DNA  sticks to whichever probes match your versions of a SNP.</p>
