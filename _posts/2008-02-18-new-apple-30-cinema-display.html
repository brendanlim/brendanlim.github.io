<p>I've been putting this off for a while, mainly because of the fact that it costs quite a bit of money.  Well, I ended up getting one today and I do not regret it one bit, especially since Edel knocked off about $800 of it for me.  Since I do work from home, it will be used quite a bit and with the amount of windows I typically have open, I'll be using it to the fullest of it's potential, well, at least the resolution.   There is indeed a correlation between screen size and productivity!  Oh, and I must say that I find it quite easy on the eyes! </p></p>
