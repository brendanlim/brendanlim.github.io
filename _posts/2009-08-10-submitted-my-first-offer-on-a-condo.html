<p>After a long day of viewing condos at Plaza Midtown, Spire, Metropolis, Paramount at Buckhead, and Buckhead Grand, we decided to try and submit an offer on one place we really liked in Spire. Turns out that one place ended up already having many offers and wasn't available. Luckily, we went back to Spire and somehow stumbled onto another condo that actually turned out to be better than the one I previously wanted. I submitted an offer today and hopefully should hear back by Wednesday. Wish me luck! <br />Â <br />Above are some pics of the place (2bdrm/2bath) -- but it really doesn't do it much justice.</p>
