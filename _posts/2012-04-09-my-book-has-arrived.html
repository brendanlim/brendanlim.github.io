<p>It's been a long time in the making but it's finally here. You can check it out on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/MacRuby-Action-Brendan-G-Lim/dp/1935182498/ref=ntt_at_ep_edition_1_1">Amazon</a> or on <a href="http://manning.com/lim">Manning's</a> page.</p>

<p class="posthaven-file posthaven-file-image posthaven-file-state-processed">
          <img class="posthaven-gallery-image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/photo_1.jpg" />
        </p>
<p class="posthaven-file posthaven-file-image posthaven-file-state-processed">
          <img class="posthaven-gallery-image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/photo_2.jpg" />
        </p>
</p></div></p>
<p>Update: Also just noticed that it mentions MacRuby for iOS on the back of the cover. There actually isn't a section on that in the book anymore because it wasn't possble at the time (and still isn't) :/</p>
