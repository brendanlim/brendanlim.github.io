<p>I've recently switched over to the world of MacVim for my development, and like most people, tried to find a good color theme to work with.  I was a big fan of the original Monokai theme for TextMate.  I later found that my friend and co-worker, Adam Bair (<a href="http://adambair.com">http://adambair.com</a>) created the Monokai Modified theme for Vim, which I loved as well.  When I used TextMate, I made some modifications to the theme to make things a little easier on my eyes.  So, I decided to make the change for my Vim setup, and with that came 'Lanai'.  I would have liked to have called it Monokai Modified Modified, but I think that wouldn't really work too well -- so I guess another Hawaiian island name had to do.</p>
