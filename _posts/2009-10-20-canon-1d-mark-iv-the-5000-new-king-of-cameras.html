<p>The <a href="http://gizmodo.com/tag/1dmarkiv/" title="Click here to read more posts tagged #1dmarkiv" class="autolink">1D Mark IV</a> uses an APS-H-sized 16-megapixel sensor that's "similar in size to a Super 35mm motion picture film frame" with a 1.3x crop factor, and a normal ISO range of 100 to 12,800, with expanded going up to 102,400 ISO. The new 45-point autofocus system has 39 cross-type points and uses a new AI Servo II AF predictive focusing algorithm that's supposed to be faster, which is handy, since it shoots in 10fps bursts.</p>
<p>But, let's talk about video, which Canon isn't too shy of making the star of this camera: You get full manual exposure control, stereo mic input, and 1080p video at 24, 25 or 30fps; 720p and standard def at 50 or 60fps; and the samples, while obviously Canon-vetted, so far <a href="http://vincentlaforet.smugmug.com/Laforet-Videos/Nocturne-Canon-1DMKIV-Video">look seriously amazing</a>.</p>
<p>There's a new auto-lighting optimizer that automatically adjusts contrast and brightness in-camera that sounds sorta like Nikon's Active D-Lighting. And hurray, a new white balance algorithm that's better at low color temperatures, something that Nikon's typically been better with in the past.</p>
<p>It's coming out in December for $5000. Man, pro DSLRs just got way more interesting again. Six-digit ISO speeds, extreme low-light performance , high-def video: It's a war.</p>
