<p>When we (Brent, Andrew, and myself), started Yappd in August, we didn't think it'd gain as much attention as it did.  Not all of it was good attention, but we were all just happy to know that people noticed what we built.  I never really spoke out about Yappd that much, but I must say that it is something that I am really proud of and I am amazed at how hard we worked to get it up and running within two weeks.  After the acquisition of Yappd's "assets" and it's closing this month, I thought it'd be good to consolidate a list of articles that mentioned Yappd.  Below is a list of all of the articles from popular publications and web blogs.  I might have missed some, and if I did let me know and I'll make sure to add it in.  Hopefully I'll be able to add another list like this for something else, but I don't think I'm allowed to do that anytime soon.</p></div></p>
