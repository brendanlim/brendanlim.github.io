There have been more than a few iPhone apps to help you find your car, but <a href="http://intridea.com/posts/use-augmented-reality-to-find-your-vehicle-with-car-finder-for-iphone">Car Finder</a> [<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=335295621&amp;mt=8">iTunes link</a>] uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality">augmented reality</a> to get you pointed in the right direction.</p>
<p>  Here's how it works: you get out of your car and mark your position, making sure you have a good GPS fix. If you don't have one, you'll be told that and see the accuracy of your fix in plus or minus meters.</p>
<p>  You can give your location a name, and if your parking space is numbered, you can add that in. I guess that is helpful if you are parking where there is no GPS signal, but then this app won't be of much help.</p>
<p>  You're then free to go your merry way, until it's time to find your car again. When you bring up the app, your iPhone camera is activated, and a red arrow points to your car. Swing the camera around until an icon for your car appears and start walking. You'll get a constant read-out of your distance.</p>
<p>  In my tests, just after sunset, the app worked very well, although when I got right next to the car the arrow was pointing elsewhere. That's not surprising given the imperfect accuracy of GPS, but by the time I got the error I could see the car less than 25 feet away.</p>
<p>  Car Finder is U.S. $0.99, so it's not over priced, and pretty much in line with other similar apps in terms of cost. The augmented reality is a nice touch, as it floats your car icon over the real world. You do get a legal warning from the app about using due caution, I guess so you won't step into a manhole or off a cliff while following the camera scene. What a litigious society we live in!</p>
<p>  So, Car Finder works, isn't over priced, uses augmented reality which has a high 'buzz word quotient,' and should impress your non-iPhone using friends, if you have any.</p>
<p>  You'll need an iPhone 3GS to make this work, because the compass and GPS do the heavy lifting.</p></div>
