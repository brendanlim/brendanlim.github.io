<span>We're extremely excited to announce the </span><a href="http://bit.ly/kicksend-iphone">new Kicksend iPhone app</a><span>. It's free, and lets you share large batches of photos, send large videos, receive files in real time, and even share files from other apps. You can </span><a href="http://bit.ly/kicksend-iphone%20%20">get it now</a><span> on the app store!</span></p>

<p><strong>Sharing Large Batches</strong></p>
<p><span>Sending photos using the default iPhone email app is extremely limiting - you can only send four photos at a time. If we take a bunch of awesome photos, we have to repeat this process many times to send them to our friends. With Kicksend for iPhone you can select up to twenty photos at a time and send them to any email address, friend, or even a list of thousands of people in high resolution.</span></p>
<p><span>In the initial version of the app, we've limited batch sharing to just photos; we'll be adding videos in the next release. </span><span> </span></p>
<p><strong>Share Files from Other Apps</strong></p>
<p><span>How have we enabled file sharing on the iPhone? Well, we've allowed you to send files from other apps using the Kicksend iPhone app.  You can send files that are too big for you to send through email and files that other applications won't normally let you share. If you have a PDF file locked up in an app on your iPhone, all you have to do is choose "Open with Kicksend" and we'll let you send it to anybody you want.  </span></p>

<p><span><strong>Delivered From Your Phone to Your Friends' Hard Drives</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If your friends have the Kicksend desktop app, any files you send them will be delivered <em>automatically</em> to their hard drives. You can be on the other side of the planet and send photos instantly to your best friend's computer, allowing them to view your pics privately, instantly, and effortlessly. </span></p>
<p><strong>Receive Files Instantly on Your iPhone, Desktop, and Web</strong></p>
<p><span>The iPhone app gives you the same great Kicksend experience that you're used to on the desktop or web. When your friends send you files, they show up <em>instantly </em>on all of the devices you have connected. You can stand next to your friend who's using the Kicksend iPhone app, send him a photo or video, and watch it appear on his screen instantly.</span></p>
<p><span>We started Kicksend with a vision of a building an effortless way to send &amp; receive the things we care about, with the people we know. This new iPhone app is a big step in that direction, and we hope you love using it as much as we do. </span></p>
