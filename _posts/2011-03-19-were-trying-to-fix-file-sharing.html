<p>As you may have heard/read, <a href="http://twitter.com/pradeep24" target="_blank">Pradeep Elankumaran</a> and I left <a href="http://intridea.com" target="_blank">Intridea</a> almost one month ago.  Since then we've been working on a new way to share files between friends and family.</p>

<p>From our personal experience file sharing still isn't as simple as it needs to be - especially for people who aren't so tech-savvy.  There are popular services out there that have sharing "tacked-on" to their feature set. Syncing files within a folder isn't always the best option either.  What if you want to segment out who gets which files?  Would you have to create new folders?  Also, what if one person deletes one of the files in the folder?  E-mail was also not a viable solution since there are limits on how big your attachments need to be.</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/receivd-early-access">Receivd</a> solves this problem.  <a href="http://bit.ly/receivd-early-access">Receivd</a> is a solution that we've built that allows friends and families to share files easily.  It's a super simple service that makes sharing a no-brainer.  Once you're connected to a person, all you need to do is drag and drop the files you want to send them.  If you want to send to multiple people at once (like your Family), you can add them to a list and just drag and drop the files to that list. </p>

<p>On the receiving side, <a href="http://bit.ly/receivd-early-access">Receivd</a> is way too simple.  To receive a file, all you have to do is watch the file come in, in real-time.  Files you receive from trusted connections will come arrive on your computer automagically and unaltered.  Imagine being on the phone with a loved one and talking to them about photos you're sending to them in real-time.  It's truly a wonderful thing to experience.</p>
<p>Currently, <a href="http://bit.ly/receivd-early-access">Receivd</a> is available as a desktop application for Mac.  We're actively working on the web application as well as mobile apps for iOS and Android.  If you'd like to try out Receivd for yourself, <a href="http://bit.ly/receivd-early-access">sign up for early access</a>.  We've been rolling out invites every single day.</p>
